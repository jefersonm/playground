Microservice: Chassi Architecture

Following Chassi Pattern (http://microservices.io/patterns/microservice-chassis.html), the idea for this project is to create a Chassi containing all best practices I believe a microservice must have.

E.g.:

- Self Registration
- Client-side discovery
- Circuit Breaker
- Security
- Scalability
- Performance
